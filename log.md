# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 2, 2023, Sunday (JavaScript Developer Tools)
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I finished the JavaScript Developer Tools lesson on The Odin Project platform and check out the additional resource Learn 14 tips and tricks in this [JavaScript 30 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkzDaKwinA8) by Wes Bos.

**Thoughts:** I've been practicing with the console, breakpoints, debugging... and more. I've used these tools before, but never really delved into them that much.

**Code:** [Chrome Devtools Tricks Code](https://github.com/carlosfrontend/chrome-dev-tools-tricks)

**Live:** [Chrome Devtools Tricks Preview](https://carlosfrontend.github.io/chrome-dev-tools-tricks/)

### Day 1: July 3, 2023, Monday (JavaScript Basic Data Structures Finished)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and I finished Basic Data Structures challenges.

**Thoughts** I had to stop and think about some of them for a long time but I finally got it.

### Day 2: July 4, 2023, Tuesday (Basic Algorithm Scripting)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone any exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Today I got stuck for hours on the Factorialize a Number challenge and thanks to the help of the programming help channel on discord I was able to get through it. After this I felt great. My thanks to the people who offer their help in these channels for their understanding, work and dedication.

### Day 3: July 5, 2023, Wednesday (Fundamentals Part 3)

**Today's Progress**: I finished [Fundamentals Part 3](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-3) capitule in The Odin Projects about functions.

**Thoughts** It has been a day full of theory. I was also practicing functions and watched a video about call stacks and how ```return``` works in the context of chained function calls.

### Day 4: July 6, 2023, Thursday (Basic Algorithm Scripting)

**Today's Progress**: I've solved several exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 5: July 7, 2023, Friday (Basic Algorithm Scripting)

**Today's Progress**: Today I continue with basic algorithm scripts on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** They were quite difficult and left me exhausted. I hope I can finish the remaining three of this theme in the next round.

### Day 6: July 8, 2023, Saturday (Basic Algorithm Scripting)

**Today's Progress**: Today I continue with basic algorithm scripts in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I finally finished the three exercises that I had left of this subject. I feel much better after completing this phase.
I struggled a long time with "Where do I Belong" because I wanted to solve it without using ```sort()```. After a lot of fighting I finally had to use it because it seemed extremely difficult without it.

### Day 7: July 9, 2023, Sunday (Front End Development Libraries)

**Today's Progress**: I did the Bootstrap course at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** It was very comfortable for me because I already knew him and hadn't played with him for a long time. It has helped me a lot to refresh concepts.

### Day 8: July 10, 2023, Monday (Javascript Basics)

**Today's Progress**: I have read various troubleshooting guides and watched a video on this issue. I learned to use a sheet of paper and a pen to first write what the problem is about and explain it in a human way before starting to code. I also understood that the best way to deal with the problem is to divide it into subproblems, what is the pseudocode and how good it is to use comments so that other programmers or oneself understand what is desired with the algorithm to be programmed.

I kept learning about errors and debugging in the odin project. I was debugging some exercises with the Chrome Dev Tool learning about the difference between an error and a warning and different types of errors like:
- Syntax Error
- Reference Error
- Type Error

**Thoughts** I understood that before programming an algorithm it is better to stop and think about how you would tell someone else about its development so that they understand it and put it on paper. Breaking this down into tiny bits and using pseudocode for it is the best way to go about it and not go blank in front of the code editor. It is a good starting point!.
