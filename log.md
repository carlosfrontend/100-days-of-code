# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 2, 2023 (JavaScript Developer Tools)
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I finished the JavaScript Developer Tools lesson on The Odin Project platform and check out the additional resource Learn 14 tips and tricks in this [JavaScript 30 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkzDaKwinA8) by Wes Bos.

**Thoughts:** I've been practicing with the console, breakpoints, debugging... and more. I've used these tools before, but never really delved into them that much.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
