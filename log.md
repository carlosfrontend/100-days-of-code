# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 2, 2023, Sunday (JavaScript Developer Tools)
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: I finished the JavaScript Developer Tools lesson on The Odin Project platform and check out the additional resource Learn 14 tips and tricks in this [JavaScript 30 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkzDaKwinA8) by Wes Bos.

**Thoughts:** I've been practicing with the console, breakpoints, debugging... and more. I've used these tools before, but never really delved into them that much.

**Code:** [Chrome Devtools Tricks Code](https://github.com/carlosfrontend/chrome-dev-tools-tricks)

**Live:** [Chrome Devtools Tricks Preview](https://carlosfrontend.github.io/chrome-dev-tools-tricks/)

### Day 1: July 3, 2023, Monday (JavaScript Basic Data Structures Finished)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp and I finished Basic Data Structures challenges.

**Thoughts** I had to stop and think about some of them for a long time but I finally got it.

### Day 2: July 4, 2023, Tuesday (Basic Algorithm Scripting)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone any exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Today I got stuck for hours on the Factorialize a Number challenge and thanks to the help of the programming help channel on discord I was able to get through it. After this I felt great. My thanks to the people who offer their help in these channels for their understanding, work and dedication.

### Day 3: July 5, 2023, Wednesday (Fundamentals Part 3)

**Today's Progress**: I finished [Fundamentals Part 3](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-3) capitule in The Odin Projects about functions.

**Thoughts** It has been a day full of theory. I was also practicing functions and watched a video about call stacks and how ```return``` works in the context of chained function calls.

### Day 4: July 6, 2023, Thursday (Basic Algorithm Scripting)

**Today's Progress**: I've solved several exercises on FreeCodeCamp..

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
